# GIGA Node Prototype 

The GIGA Prototype Node is meant to showcase the potential of GIGA future Noders, test functionalities and validate hardware requirements. The Nodes will be deployed in pilot schools and used to promote their deployment in other countries. Giga is a partnership between UNICEF and ITU that aims to connect every school to the internet, and every young person to information, opportunity and choice. Schools connected through Giga will work as nodes to test and prove solutions to integrate young people and communities to information, opportunity and choice.
